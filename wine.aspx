            <p>Stop by for free Wine Tastings on the First Friday of each month (except January) from 5-8 PM. Each month we will have a different Northwest winery offering a sample of their best wines. A representative (or the winemaker) from the winery will guide you through your flight. They will answer any questions you might have while introducing  you to new varietals or sharing notes on Northwest favorites.</p>
            <p>Be sure to check our schedule for Wine and Chocolate Pairing Tastings (September to May) on the third Friday of the month. This is a more intimate tasting with amazing chocolates selected to perfectly pair with the flight of the night.</p>
            <p>We strive to find the best, small production, hand crafted wineries that create amazing wines at reasonable prices.</p>

            <br />
            <p>
            Lujon Syrah is an excellent example of the Walla Walla AVA character. Co-fermented with 3.5% Viognier, it expresses a unique mix of wild berry, spice, acid and earth. It has amazing persistence and pure varietal character.

            Once again, the Spofford Station fruit shines! This is a muscular, fully ripe, textural and dense wine with a seamless mix of red, blue and black fruits that sails effortlessly into the ripe tannins. The underpinning of firm acid and a hint of oak serves to expand the wine in the mouth, adding breadth and depth.

            <br />
            <p>
            <em>Year: 2009</em>
            <br />
            <br />
            A blend that incorporates the broad expression of the two very distinct Cost and Crawford Beck vineyards in the Amity Hills, coupled with the diverse volcanic and sedimentary components from the Luminous Hills vineyard in the Yamhill-Carlton District. Designed to be approachable and accessible, but still with signature of the winemaking old world, using all traditional, natural methods.

        <span class="supplierHeadings">Seven of Hearts Grenache/Syrah/Mourvedre - $22</span>

            <p>
            <em>Year: 2010</em>
            <br />
            <br />
            Sourced from vineyards along the Washington side of the Columbia Gorge in the Columbia Valley AVA, this wine is inspired by the great red wines of the Rhone region of France. The Grenache provides elegance and penetrating fruit coupled with the meaty depth of the Syrah, and brooding inky dark leathery fruit of the Mourvedre.

            Chocovine is a fine French Cabernet subtly combined with a rich, dark chocolate from Holland, paired together to create a decadently smooth, rich drink. It can be served on the rocks or as the main ingredient in an array of sinful cocktails.
