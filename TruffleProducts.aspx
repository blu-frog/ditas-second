                Tucked away in a small corner of the lush Willamette Valley, the Briggitine Monks use only the finest local ingredients to craft their Hand Rolled Truffles Royale. 
                These huge masterpieces are available individually or gift wrapped in a 7.5 oz box containing 6 truffles.

                <br />
                The fudge is melt-in-your-mouth goodness, smooth and creamy beyond belief because, as they say, the recipe is "heavenly".
                Be sure to try the Cherry Nut Fudge only available during the winter holidays.

                In 1986 Michele Chirgwin started making chocolates and candy in her own home. 
                It wasn't long until she developed a full line of truffles, chocolates, fudge and sweet treats - all of which are still made in the Clackamas facility. 
                Clusters, melts, crisps, chews, novelties and sugar-free, Michele's has them all.
                <br />
                <br />
                Dita's is delighted to bring you a sample of her line including the famous Oregon Marionberry bar!

                Organic and unusual – just the way we like it! 
                Lille Belle grows many of their own ingredients on their farm and then mixes and matches to come up with the most interesting combinations. 
                A smokey blue cheese truffle, berry fruit cups, a chili chocolate bar so hot it’s called “Do Not Eat This Chocolate” – if you’re looking for a new chocolate experience, Lillie Belle never disappoints.
